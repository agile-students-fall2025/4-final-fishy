## How TripMate Started

TripMate began during our Agile Development course as a project to practice **Scrum methodology** and full-stack collaboration.  
The concept evolved from early brainstorming around travel apps and personal trackers — we chose TripMate to combine both ideas.

We’re currently in **Sprint 0**, focusing on research, wireframes, and environment setup.
